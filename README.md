# Invasion

**THIS PROJECT AND README ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the project then we recommend jumping onto our [Discord](https://discord.gg/EdmwgVk), so we can better coordinate everything.

We're currently looking for programmers, level designers, modellers, animators and artists, so if you're any one of those then your help would be greatly appreciated!

### Programming

A rough style guide can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/stg/coding-style-conventions) and [here](http://web.mst.edu/~cpp/common/hungarian.html), for anyone looking
to contribute. Valve have never officially outlined their style but it seems to follow Microsoft's own conventions for the most part, which are very similar if not the same as Hungarian Notation.
